  summarise(lifeExp = median(lifeExp)) 

```

## Task 5: Data visualization

Thank you for working through the previous tasks. We are convinced that you have done a great job, but because the task descriptions aren't always unambiguous, we have imported the data that we would have expected to be created and stored in the objects `gapminder_2007`, `gapminder_summary_2007` and `gapminder_summary_continent_year` at the previous code chunks. This is to ensure that you can work through the following tasks.

1.  Run the code contained in the code chunk below to import the data.

```{r}
#| label: load-data

gapminder_2007 <- read_rds(here::here("data/gapminder-2007.rds"))

gapminder_summary_2007 <- read_rds(here::here("data/gapminder-summary-2007.rds"))

gapminder_summary_continent_year <- read_rds(here::here("data/gapminder-summary-continent-year.rds"))

```

## Task 6: Create a boxplot

1.  A code chunk has already been created.

2.  Use the `ggplot()` function and the `gapminder_2007` object to create a boxplot with the following aesthetic mappings:

-   continent to the x-axis;
-   life expectancy to the y-axis;
-   continent to color using the `fill = continent` argument inside `aes()`

3.  Do not display (ignore) the outliers in the plot. **Note: Use a search engine or an AI tool to find the solution and add the link to the solution you have found.**

    <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14207739/how-to-remove-outliers-in-boxplot-in-r>

4.  Run the code contained in the code chunk and fix any errors.

5.  What are the data types of the three variables used for aesthetic mappings?

    solution: continent = categorical var, lifeExp = continuos var, fill = categorical var

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2007, 
       mapping = aes(x = continent,
                     y = lifeExp,
                     fill = continent)) + 
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape=NA)
```

## Task 7: Create a timeseries plot

1.  A code chunk has already been created.

2.  Use the `ggplot()` function and the `gapminder_summary_continent_year` object to create a connected scatterplot (also called timeseries plot) using the `geom_line()` and `geom_point()`functions with the following aesthetic mappings:

-   year to the x-axis;
-   life expectancy to the y-axis;
-   continent to color using the `color = continent` argument inside `aes()`

3.  Run the code contained in the code chunk and fix any errors.

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder_summary_continent_year,
       mapping = aes(x = year,
                     y = lifeExp,
                     color = continent)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()
```

## Task 8: Create a barplot

### with `geom_col()`

1.  A code chunk has already been created.

2.  Use the `ggplot()` function and the `gapminder_summary_2007` object to create a barplot using the `geom_col()` function with the following aesthetic mappings:

-   continent to the x-axis;
-   count to the y-axis;

3.  Run the code contained in the code chunk and fix any errors.

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder_summary_2007,
       mapping = aes(x = continent,
                     y = count)) +
  geom_col()
```

### with `geom_bar()`

1.  A code chunk has already been created.

2.  Use the `ggplot()` function and the `gapminder_2007` object to create a barplot using the `geom_bar()` function with the following aesthetic mappings:

-   continent to the x-axis;

3.  Run the code contained in the code chunk and fix any errors.

4.  The plot is identical to the plot created with `geom_col()`. Why? What does the `geom_bar()` function do? Write your text here: geom_bar() automattically assigns a value to the y axis. By default this seems to be the count of objects per category on x.

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2007,
       mapping = aes(x = continent)) +
  geom_bar()
```

## Task 9: Create a histogram

1.  A code chunk has already been created.

2.  Use the `ggplot()` function and the `gapminder_2007` object to create a histogram using the `geom_histogram()` function with the following aesthetic mappings:

-   life expectancy to the x-axis;
-   continent to color using the `fill = continent` argument inside `aes()`

3.  Run the code contained in the code chunk and fix any errors.

4.  Inside the `geom_histogram()` function, add the following arguments and values:

-   `col = "grey30"`
-   `breaks = seq(40, 85, 2.5)`

5.  Run the code contained in the code chunk and fix any errors.

6.  Describe how the `geom_histogram()` function is similar to the `geom_bar()` function.

    Solution: `geom_histogram()` also calculates the count and assigns it to y.

7.  What happens by adding the 'breaks' argument? Play around with the numbers inside of `seq()` to see what changes. Describe here what you observe:

    Solution: breaks lets you adjust the width of the window and the bins. The values describe seq(start, end, bin width)

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2007,
       mapping = aes(x = lifeExp,
                     fill = continent)) +
  geom_histogram(col = "grey30",
                 breaks = seq(50, 85, 2))
```

## Task 10: Scatterplot and faceting

1.  A code chunk has already been created.

2.  Use the `ggplot()` function and assign `gapminder_2007` and create a scatterplot using the `geom_point()`function with the following aesthetic mappings:

-   gdpPercap the x-axis;
-   lifeExp to the y-axis;
-   population to the size argument;
-   country to color using the `color = country` argument inside `aes()`

4.  Run the code contained in the code chunk and fix any errors.

5.  Use the variable continent to facet the plot by adding: `facet_wrap(~continent)`.

6.  Edit `geom_point()` to remove the legend: `geom_point(show.legend = FALSE)`

7.  Run the code contained in the code chunk and fix any errors.

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2007,
       mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                     y = lifeExp,
                     size = pop,
                     color = country)) +
  geom_point(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~continent)
```

## Task 11: Create a lineplot and use facets

1.  A code chunk with complete code has already been prepared.

2.  Run the code contained in the code chunk and fix any errors.

3.  Remove the '\#' sign at the line that starts with the `scale_color_manual()` function

4.  What is stored in the `country_colors` object? Find out by executing the object in the Console (type it to the Console and hit enter). Do the same again, but with a question mark `?country_colors`.

5.  Next to the code chunk option `#| eval:` change the value from `false` to `true`.

6.  Render the document and fix any errors.

```{r}
#| eval: true

ggplot(data = gapminder,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = lifeExp, 
                     group = country, 
                     color = country)) +
  geom_line(lwd = 1, show.legend = FALSE) + 
  facet_wrap(~continent) +
  scale_color_manual(values = country_colors) +
  theme_minimal() 

```

## Task 12: Create a choropleth Maps

You can also prepare maps with `ggplot2`. It's beyond the scope of the class to teach you the foundations of spatial data in R, but a popular package to work with spatial data is the `sf` (Simple Features) R Package. The `rnaturalearth` R Package facilitates world mapping by making [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) map data more easily available to R users.

The code chunk below contains code for a world map that shows countries by income group. To view the map, do the following:

1.  Run the code contained in the code chunk and fix any errors.

2.  Next to the code chunk option `#| eval:` change the value from `false` to `true`.

3.  Render the document and fix any errors.

```{r}
#| eval: true

world <- ne_countries(scale = "small", returnclass = "sf")

world |> 
  mutate(income_grp = factor(income_grp, ordered = T)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(fill = income_grp)) + 
  geom_sf() +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "top") +
  labs(fill = "Income Group:") +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE))


```

The code for the code chunk is taken from here: More here: https://bookdown.org/alhdzsz/data_viz_ir/maps.html
